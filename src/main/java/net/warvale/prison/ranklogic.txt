There's three different rank levels;

1. Network rank level (TOP PRIORITY)
- Includes prefixes from staffcore like [ADMIN] [MOD] [BUILDER] etc. Should ALWAYS be on the far left and the same color.

2. Prison-rank level (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- Includes stars for ranks like Warden or Guard (❈,✵) etc. Should always show RIGHT BEFORE USERNAME. 

3. Wanted-level rank level (LOWEST PRIORITY)
- The wanted-level system will track your money/corruption and give you a star (for example, 500 corruption points/exp for 2 stars, etc)
- Every time you get a new corruption point, it will display like so:

---
[NETWORK LEVEL] [3⋆] [PRISON-RANK LEVEL {if applicable}] Username: Chat
---

Here is an example;

[ADMIN] [6⋆] ❈ Pixelific: Hey guys

Explained:
[ADMIN] his network level rank
[6⋆] how many wanted levels he has
❈ his warden star

Wanted star levels:

1⋆ unlocked by default
2⋆ 500exp
3⋆ 2300 exp
4⋆ 10800 exp
5⋆ 45300 exp
6⋆ 162,500 exp
7⋆ 452,120 exp
8⋆ 1,245,980 exp
9⋆ 4,560,370 exp

How to gain exp:

- Take the cost (in vales) of an item when purchased; subtract half, add that to a user's exp
- Give 500 exp when beating the warehouse
- Give 2000 exp when killing a guard
- Give 250 exp when killing a player
- Reward 100 exp for every hour of playtime

In the future, gaining exp can also come from owning gangs, beating quests, winning jail-games, etc.
